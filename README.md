### Flutter & Dart

The app is built using **Flutter**, Google's UI toolkit, which enables fast, expressive, and highly performant applications across platforms.

- **Language**: Dart
  - Dart is a client-optimized programming language, enabling smooth and fast application performance.
  - Dart's modern syntax and simple structure help make the app more maintainable and easy to extend.
  - With features like null safety, strong typing, and asynchronous support, Dart enhances the app’s robustness.

- **Flutter Widgets**:
  - Predefined and custom Flutter widgets like `Text`, `Column`, `Container`, and `Image` are used to create responsive and dynamic layouts.
  - State management is handled using Flutter's stateful widgets, ensuring smooth UI updates in response to weather data changes.

- **Icons**:
  - Weather condition icons are dynamically displayed based on real-time data to provide a visual representation of current weather conditions. Icons such as ☀️, 🌧️, ⛅, and ❄️ are used throughout the UI.
